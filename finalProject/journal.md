For the final project, I intend to make use of the user's sound to control a game. This project will have multiple ways for the user to affect the game state. The primary interaction will be with the user's sound, but the user can also use potentiometers, buttons, and other sensors to create the artwork or play the game. For example, the user can increase or decrease the sensitivity of the game with the potentionmeter. 

My inspiration comes from games like these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKor95hcCs
