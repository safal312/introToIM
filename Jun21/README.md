# Musical Instrument with LDR sensor
In this project, I made a musical instrument with the use of an LDR sensor along with two switches. When the red button is pressed, the musical instrument is turned on and a default tone is played. In order to change the note, the user has to press the yellow button and try to change the amount of light falling on the LDR sensor while doing so. The sketch maps the brightness value from the sensor and maps it between the frequency of 50 and 1000. This frequency is then played from the buzzer.

In general, the higher you put your hand from the sensor, the higher the note gets and vice versa. The notes don't change in any increments, so the user can expect any kind of notes between the frequencies of 50 and 1000 when they try to play the instrument.
